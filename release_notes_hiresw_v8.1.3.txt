updated (bug fix) to version v8.1.3 

scripts/arw/exhiresw_smartinit.sh 
scripts/fv3/exhiresw_smartinit.sh

to check, sleep, then timeout searching for every file, instead of every 3 like previously. See header of these scripts for more information. This is to address a failure in 08/2022 when files were available out of order, the previous coding assumed the files would be
sequentially available, so if 3 was ready, so was 2 and 1. This is a more strict check.
