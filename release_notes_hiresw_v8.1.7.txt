Makes the changes described below under resource changes.

Also ncludes a few more modifications unrelated to the fix, but needed to build code 
(fixes some modulefiles).  I mostly wanted to get these into my code base.

Increases the node count from 10 to 11 for the AK FV3 forecast job.  
The task layout changes from 24x48 to 28x48.
The task count increases from 1200 to 1392.

In testing the combination of these changes had the model run about 3.5 minutes faster.
Keeping the node/task count unchanged would add about 6-7 minutes to the run time with
the n_split value increase.
