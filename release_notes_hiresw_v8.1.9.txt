#####################
Update overview

#####################
Obtaining the package
#####################

Clone it with this command (but change hiresw.v8.1.9 to whatever you want to

Modified files:
#############################

jobs/JHIRESW_FORECAST

Defines a new COMOUTrestart directory ($COMOUT/RESTART), and creates this directory when running for the Guam FV3 run only.

scripts/fv3/exhiresw_forecast.sh

Eliminates some unused logic saving restart files (for non-tm00 times), and adds a new block to save restart output from f06 to f24 from the Guam FV3 run only.  Restart files copied to COMOUTrestart

parm/fv3/model_configure_fv3.tmp_guam_ccpp

Changes the frequency of restart writes for the Guam FV3 run from every 6 h to every hour.

versions/run.ver

Updated hiresw_ver to v8.1.9

#############################
Resource changes:
#############################


Timing and possible compute resources:
Roughly 2.5 minutes longer run time for Guam FV3 forecast job with these changes (about 2 minutes from writing restart files more frequently, and about 30 seconds from the new copying of the restart files to an output directory).  

The Guam FV3 forecast job currently just partially fills 2 nodes, so we could increase computing resources without a node usage increase if we want to avoid this delay.  However, in testing, increasing to a possible larger task count resulted in runs several minutes faster than the current operational run.  

Storage:

Adds roughly 36 GB/day to /com type storage, and about 48 GB/cycle to the /tmp run directory for the Guam FV3 forecast job.
